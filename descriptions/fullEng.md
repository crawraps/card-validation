# Project purpose

This project is the implementation of a test task for getting a junior frontend developer vacancy. The essence of the task was to create an application component. The component itself is a form with validation of fields for subsequent senfing of the entered data to the server. This is what concerns the frontend part.

I also needed to receive data on a server organized using [express]() and the [mongo]().

# Tasks

This project was created to obtain the position of a frontend developer. Oddly enough, its main task was to complete the task itself.

# Execution and difficulties

In the part of the frontend I didn't face any difficulties. Although I had to use [mui]() and, accordingly, recall and scroll through the documentation of this library.

Doing this task also caused me some server side difficulties. In particular, I hadn't used [express]() and [mongo](). I only knew about them in theory.

Fortunately in order to meet the needs of the customer, there was no need to know these technologies in depth, so it was enough for me to read documentation and read a couple of lessons on these technologies.

# Conclusions

I did not receive a response from the employer after completing this test task unfortunately. But I still got an interesting experience. I was able to try out [express]() and [mongo]() and I realized that I want to use them in the future.
